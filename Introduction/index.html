        <p>I’ve always been very creative. I just need to keep my hands busy, that’s why there’s always a knitting project in my bag. Whether it’s cross stitch, crochet or sewing somehow I have the talent to learn and do practically every craft involving needle and thread.</p>

        <p>I’m not really into sports, but I’ve been diving since I was 14 years old. My dad is a diving instructor and I’ve always wanted to go with him. Last year we went to the Philippines and we’ve also been to Indonesia and Curacao.</p>

        <p>Other things I also love are videogames and cats. I’ve been playing a lot of World of Warcraft again lately, but I also really like things as Destiny 2 or Halo. And there is nothing better than playing my game with a cat on my lap or next to me.</p>
